JavaScript data structure library.

> **NOTE:** at this moment this library is the result of some exercises I have been doing to learn about data strucutre algorithms. I don't make any claims regarding performance or implementation details but any ideas on how to improve the solutions is very welcome. If you want a more mature solution, you may check Mauricio Santo's [Buckets](https://github.com/mauriciosantos/Buckets-JS) library.

> **NOTE2:** you can see the the algorithms I intend to implement in the issue tracker.
